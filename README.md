# Build from bluefin and aurora

## Bluefin - [projectbluefin.io](https://projectbluefin.io)

Bluefin strives to cover these two use cases. For end users it provides a system as reliable as a Chromebook with near-zero maintainance, with the power of homebrew, flathub, and a container runtime to give you access to all the best software Open Source has to offer. Check [Introduction to Bluefin](https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/introduction-to-bluefin/41) for a feature walkthrough.

Aurora is a delightful KDE desktop experience for end-users that are looking for reliability and developers for the most-hassle free setup. Zero maintenance included.
